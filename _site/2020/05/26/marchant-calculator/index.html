  <h1 class="post-title">Marchant "Silent Speed" Mechanical Calculator Repair and Operation.</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 May 2020</span>
  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>I was able to acquire a Marchant ACR8M “Silent Speed” mechanical calculator bought off of Ebay. This is the calculator after some light cleaning and repair.</p>

<p><img src="https://starwarsfan2099.github.io/public/2020-5-26/DSC_5599_2.jpg" alt="Front view" /></p>

<p>The calculator includes it’s serial number and patent information on the bottom of the machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://starwarsfan2099.github.io/public/2020-5-26/DSC_5619.JPG" alt="Patent info" /></p>

<p>The model number is listed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACR8M-161734</code>. Serial numbers 161,000 - 165,00 were manufactured in 1942. Serial numbers and manufacture dates for the <em>Silent Speed</em>, <em>Figuremaster</em>, and <em>Figurmatic</em> can be found on <a href="http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/marchant.html">this page</a>. The calculator was in very good condition. Outer panels have light scratching and flaking as well as decade old tape residue. The Marchant painted logos are still present in all places. With only minimal surface cleaning, the calculator looks quite nice. The tape residue is resistant to any cleaners I put on and is completely hardened. Attempts to scrape it off resulted in paint coming off as well so I have left it for now.</p>

<p><img src="https://starwarsfan2099.github.io/public/2020-5-26/DSC_5611.JPG" alt="Keyboard view" /></p>

<p>The calculator has 8 key columns (<code class="highlighter-rouge">8M</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACR8M</code>) ont the keyboard for digit entry. Each column consists of 1 - 9, with a 10th red key at the bottom. The bottom row of keys is used to clear or zero a individual column and set it back to zero. The keyboard only allows one key to be pressed at a time in each column. Pressing another key releases the previous one that was pressed in a column. The keyboard also contains 9 decimal indicators. They can be flipped over to a painted white side via the wheels below the zeroing keys. This is used to help keep track of decimal places. Above the keyboard is a display register that shows the currently pressed keys on the keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://starwarsfan2099.github.io/public/2020-5-26/DSC_5610.JPG" alt="Controls view" /></p>

<p>Beside the keyboard, there are control keys and another column of keys. In the top right, is a red auto division key. To the right, is the division stop key. Below that row is the addition and subtraction keys. To the right of the subtraction keys is the carriage shift-direction keys. There is a shift left, no shift, and shift right key. These keys determine which way the carriage moves during tabulation and during multiplication. Below those three keys is a reverse key. The reverse key, when set, does the opposite of the operation pressed (addition or subtraction). In-between the reverse and addition keys is a small lever. This lever, when set downwards, causes the carriage return to a position determined by which shift-key is currently set and clear the result register after division. If the shift right key is pressed and the lever is down, after a division the carriage will automatically return to the right and clear the result register. If the lever is in the up position the carriage will not move or clear after a division. In the bottom left is the keyboard clear button. This key clears all columns on the keyboard. To the right of that key, is the tab and clear keys. The tab key returns the machine to position determined by the shift-keys. Below the tab key are two carriage clear keys. A result register clear key and a counter register clear key. All three keys can be pressed at the same time.</p>

<p>To the right of those keys, is a column of digits. This is the <em>“on-the-fly”</em> multiplier. Pressing these keys multiplies what is in the result register by the key pressed, and increments the counter register by that amount.</p>
