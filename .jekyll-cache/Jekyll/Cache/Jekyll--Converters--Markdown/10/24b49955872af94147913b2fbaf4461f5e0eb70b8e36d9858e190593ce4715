I"y<p>Hi, my name is Andrew Clark. Iâ€™m studying Digital Forensics and Information Assurance at Marshall University. I have a passion for cybersecurity, programming, reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and robotics. My goal for this blog is to share information I learn, projects I create, or just stuff I find interesting and want to share with others. I plan to do several blog posts on reverse engineering, exploitation, debugging, electronics, and who knows what else. I hope you can learn something or at least share in my excitement about the inner workings of technology!</p>

<p>If you want, here are some other ways you can follow me:</p>
