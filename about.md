Hi, my name is Andrew Clark. I'm a student at Marshall University studying Digital Forensics and Information Assurance. I have a passion for cybersecurity, programming, reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and robotics. My goal with this blog is to share information I learn, projects I create, or just stuff I find interesting and want to share with others. I plan to do several blog posts on reverse engineering, exploitation, debugging, electronics, and who knows what else. I hope you can learn something or share in my excitement about the inner workings of technology!
