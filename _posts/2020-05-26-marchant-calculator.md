# Overview 

I was able to acquire a Marchant ACR8M "Silent Speed" mechanical calculator bought off of Ebay. This is the calculator after some light cleaning and repair.

The calculator includes it's serial number and patent information on the bottom of the machine.

The model number is listed as `ACR8M-161734`. Serial numbers 161,000 - 165,00 were manufactured in 1942. Serial numbers and manufacture dates for the *Silent Speed*, *Figuremaster*, and *Figurmatic* can be found on [this page](http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/marchant.html). The calculator was in very good condition. Outer panels have light scratching and flaking as well as decade old tape residue. The Marchant painted logos are still present in all places. With only minimal surface cleaning, the calculator looks quite nice. The tape residue is resistant to any cleaners I put on and is completely hardened. Attempts to scrape it off resulted in paint coming off as well so I have left it for now.

The calculator has 8 key columns (`8M` in `ACR8M`) ont the keyboard for digit entry. Each column consists of 1 - 9, with a 10th red key at the bottom. The bottom row of keys is used to clear or zero a individual column and set it back to zero. The keyboard only allows one key to be pressed at a time in each column. Pressing another key releases the previous one that was pressed in a column. The keyboard also contains 9 decimal indicators. They can be flipped over to a painted white side via the wheels below the zeroing keys. This is used to help keep track of decimal places.
